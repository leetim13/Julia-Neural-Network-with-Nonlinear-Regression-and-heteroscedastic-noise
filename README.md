# Julia-Neural-Network-with-Nonlinear-Regression-and-heteroscedastic-noise
This project experiments with fitting linear and non-linear regression models with both MLE and neural networks.

* Linear Regression: implemented with both MLE and multi-layer neural network (trained using gradient descent with negative log-likelihood).
* Non-linear Regression (with heteroscedastic noise/input dependent varaince): trained a fully connected network (multi-layer perceptron) to capture the variability of input data with 10-dimensional hidden layer and `tanh` nonlinearity.

## Implementations include:
* **`Julia-Neural-Network-with-Nonlinear-Regression-and-heteroscedastic-noise.ipynb`** the final jupyter notebook project.
